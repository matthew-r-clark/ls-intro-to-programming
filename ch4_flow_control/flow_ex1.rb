# Write down whether the following expressions return true or false. Then type the expressions into irb to see the results.
#
# 1. (32 * 4) >= 129
# 2. false != !true
# 3. true == 4
# 4. false == (847 == '847')
# 5. (!true || (!(100 / 5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false

# 1. false (32 * 4 = 128, which is less than 129)
# 2. false (false DOES equal not true)
# 3. false (true is not equal to 4)
# 4. true (847 is not equal to the string '847', and false does equal false)
# 5. true (only one item needs to be true, and that is ((328 / 4) == 82))
